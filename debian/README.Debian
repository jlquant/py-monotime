python-monotime for Debian
--------------------------

This brings time.monotonic() to versions of python that doesn't have it (ie.
versions before python 3.3).  Example:

	try:
	  import monotime
	except ImportError:
	  pass  # maybe we already have time.monotonic
	import time
	
	print time.monotonic()
